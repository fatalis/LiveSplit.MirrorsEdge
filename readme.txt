MENL (Mirror's Edge No Loads) is an automatic load time remover for Mirror's
Edge. It's both easier and more accurate than manually editing a video to cut
out loads. It is designed to be RTA Without Loads; only loading is removed.
Types of loading removed: static load screens (starting a level, dying),
mid-game loading (as seen after the Ropeburn death cutscene on some PCs),
level streaming (the thing it does in elevator rides and Out of Bounds
glitches).

Requirements:

    LiveSplit 1.3+ (if enough people yell at me, I'll make a standalone version)
    Mirror's Edge (PC) - Steam, Origin, DVD, or No-CD crack

Install:

    Extract the contents of the zip file to your LiveSplit folder and overwrite
    everything.

    64-bit users only: Close LiveSplit and run LiveSplit32BitPatcher. This will not
    be required in the next version of LiveSplit.

    Restart LiveSplit. Add MENL in LiveSplit's Layout Editor.

Notes:

    If you need auto-splitting, you can use the one chillmastor made:

    (Disabled for now) If you hold F10 while starting the game up, a debug console
    will appear. If something isn't working you can copy the output of it.

    If you're wondering why it pauses awkwardly in elevators, it's because it 
    only pauses when the game is actually loading something. Each elevator has
    a fixed "start-up" duration that occurs before anything starts loading.

Changelog:
