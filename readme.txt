MENL (Mirror's Edge No Loads) is an automatic load time remover for Mirror's
Edge. It's both easier and more accurate than manually editing a video to cut
out loads. It is designed to be RTA Without Loads; only loading is removed.
Types of loading removed: static load screens (starting a level, dying),
mid-game loading (as seen after the Ropeburn death cutscene on some PCs),
level streaming (the thing it does in elevator rides and Out of Bounds
glitches). Starting with v1.2, it can also split for you automatically at the
end of a chapter.

Requirements:

    LiveSplit 1.4+
    Mirror's Edge (PC) - Steam, Origin, DVD, or No-CD crack

Install:

    Enter "Mirror's Edge" in LiveSplit's splits editor. Click activate.

Notes:

    (Disabled for now) If you hold F10 while starting the game up, a debug console
    will appear. If something isn't working you can copy the output of it.

    If you're wondering why it pauses awkwardly in elevators, it's because it 
    only pauses when the game is actually loading something. Each elevator has
    a fixed "start-up" duration that occurs before anything starts loading.
